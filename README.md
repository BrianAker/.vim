Hi!

This is a checkin of a cleaned up (well... somewhat...) version of my vim setup. The idea is to start all over. After 20+ years it had just become too complicated.

To install check it out into your .vim directory. Then type "make" followed by "make install".

Plugins are enabled/disabled by commenting them out in bundle.vim.

The vimrc.vim will overwrite your $HOME/.vimrc file.
